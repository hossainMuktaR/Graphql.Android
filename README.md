# GraphQL Android

A simple Android application that demonstrates how to use GraphQL to fetch and manipulate data. This project serves as a starting point for developers interested in integrating GraphQL into their Android applications.

## Summary

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. This project showcases how to make GraphQL requests and handle the responses effectively in an Android application.

## Features

- Fetch data from a GraphQL API.
- Display data in a user-friendly interface.
- Handle errors gracefully.
  
## Technologies Used

- Kotlin
- Android SDK
- Apollo GraphQL Client
- Coroutines for asynchronous programming
  
## API Used

This application uses the following GraphQL API:
- **API Endpoint**: [https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql]
- **Documentation**: [https://github.com/trevorblades/countries]

## How It Works

1. **GraphQL Setup**: This app uses Apollo Client to interact with the GraphQL API. The schema is defined in a `.graphql` file.
2. **Fetching Data**: The app fetches data by sending queries to the GraphQL endpoint.
3. **Displaying Data**: The retrieved data is parsed and displayed in the app's UI.
4. **Mutations**: The app can also send mutations to modify data in the backend.
